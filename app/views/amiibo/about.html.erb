<h2>About This Project</h2>

<p>The data I have decided to use contains information about Nintendo’s amiibo figures and cards. The data includes information about the amiibo figures, the characters they represent, the series the amiibo belong to, the series the characters belong to, and the type of amiibo (whether or not they are figures, cards, etc). For the purposes of this project, I would be using every data set except for the type data. The game series, amiibo series, and character tables have an identical structure: each table simply has an ID and a name. The amiibo table would contain an ID, foreign keys representing the character the figure/card portrays, along with the game series and amiibo series they belong to, an image for the amiibo saved as a string, a name for the amiibo, release date information for Japan and North America, and a string detailing the amiibo’s type. Additionally, time permitting, I would also be importing a CSV file containing information about games that support amiibos, and be creating a join table that details the functionality of each game. The games table would contain the game’s title, its developer, and release date information for Japan and North America. The join table would contain foreign keys for the amiibo figures and the games they work with, along with a description of what each amiibo does when connected to each game.</p>
